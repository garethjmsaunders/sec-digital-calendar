Introduction
============

The enclosed file (churchdates2004.csv) enables you to import into the Microsoft Outlook Calendar and potentially other Calendar programs (including some PDA applications such as your Palmpilot using an appropriate conduit) entries for key dates and festivals in the 2001 calendar.

This includes:

* Key Saints Days for both the Anglican and Roman Catholic Lectionaries
* Major and Minor Festivals, including 2003 moveable feasts
* Readings for each day from the Roman Lectionaries

Please note that in order to delete these entries, you will have to manually remove each item as the import procedure performs a bulk upload of these date events.

Version 1.1 et seq does not mark the time as busy, so will not mess up your diary.

How to Import into Outlook
==========================

1. Load Microsoft Outlook.
2. Select File, then "Import and Export".
3. Select "Import from another program or file".
4. Select "Comma Separated Values (Windows)".
5. Browse to where you unzipped this file (churchdates2004.csv).
6. Select the database you wish to import.
7. Select the option marked "Replace duplicates with items imported".
8. Click Next.
9. Select "Calendar" or wherever you store you calendar information.
10. Click Next.
11. Click on Finish.

Note: This procedure was tested using MS Outlook 2000 and XP. Previous versions may vary slightly but should still be compatible.

If updating from any previous version for the same year, remember to select 'replace duplicates with imported items' in step 7 above. If you are loading this version in addition to last years, do not worry as the dates do not overlap.

Importing into Lotus Organiser by Don Quilty
============================================

"When I turned to the anniversary mode I found that I had very little problem importing Fr Simon's Data.  Anniversaries can then be 'Shown through' into the calendar. The final effect being the Saints day, reading etc. are shown in a different colour at the top of the day. 
 
Using the Customise instruction add an extra 'anniversary section'
Section, customise, add..... anniversary, Giving it any name you like, mine is called Ordo.
 
Then import Fr Simon's Data into this new section, mapping the data as appropriate.
 
Turn back to you Calendar, select section,show through ... choose you new anniversary section
 
Hopefully the data will appear in your calendar."
