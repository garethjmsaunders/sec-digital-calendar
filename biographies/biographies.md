17 July
Jane Haining, Missionary and Martyr, 1944 [6] Red

Born 6 June 1897 Dunscore, Scotland; died 17 July 1944 Auschwitz Birkenau, German Greater Governance
Christian Missionary, Scottish Mission to the Jews, Budapest 1932–1944
Righteous Among the Nations (Yad Vashem, 1997), British Hero of the Holocaust (UK Government, 2010)

The Liturgy Committee recommends the proposal that Jane Haining be included in the SEC Calendar on account of her faith-filled life and example that saw her die in the Nazi Concentration camp of Auschwitz Birkenau.

Jane Haining was born in the Scottish Borders, lived in Glasgow and felt called as a Church of Scotland Missionary in Budapest, Hungary. Her mission work was caring for Jewish children.  At the outbreak of World War II, she was asked to return to Scotland and refused.  She was subsequently arrested and transported to Auschwitz having refused to abandon the children in her charge. She is the only Scot known to have died in Auschwitz.
Jane Haining is well-known in Hungary (there is a street named for her in Budapest) but less so in Scotland. Work has been going on between SEC and Church of Scotland colleagues on educational materials on Jane Haining and the Holocaust for Scottish schools. There has been a book on her life by Mary Miller, Jane Haining: A Life of Love & Courage, and play by Raymond Raszowski Ross, A Promised Land.
The honour of inclusion in the Calendar would be on a parallel with the Roman Catholic Church’s memorial to Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish Catholic priest and Conventual Franciscan friar who volunteered to die in place of a stranger in the Nazi death camp of Auschwitz. He is venerated as Saint Maximilian Kolbe.
Jane Haining was a faithful Christian, and the only Scot known to have died in Auschwitz. On account of her refusal to abandon those for whom she had care, and her death as a result, she is recognised as Righteous among the Nations (an honorific used by the State of Israel to describe non-Jews who risked their lives during the Holocaust to save Jews from extermination by the Nazis). She is also an outstanding example of Christian witness in a life lived for others – and this case, those of other faiths – and the willingness to face death as a result.
This is an opportunity to not only celebrate Jane Haining, her life and service, but also to include the Church of Scotland, Interfaith partners and the Hungarian community in so doing.
The date suggested, 17 July does not clash with another celebration
