# Biographies for Saints' Days and Festivals<br>of the Scottish Episcopal Church

## About

This document is my work-in-progress draft of biographies for Saints' Days and Festivals of the Scottish Episcopal Church. My aim is to make this a freely avaliable resource for the SEC digital calendar and website.

While there are at least two similar resources for the Scottish Episcopal Church:

* _Exciting Holiness_ (2nd edition), edited by Brother Tristan, SSF, Canterbury Press, 2003
* A local resource created by a former provost at the Cathedral of St Andrew, Inverness in the Diocese of Moray, Ross and Caithness.

both are subject to copyright restrictions, so I decided to write my own.

### The Naming of Jesus [2] White
#### 1 January

Sometimes referred to as the feast of the naming and circumcision of Jesus, this scriptural festival marks three events.

First, the circumcision of Jesus is a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham 'and his children for ever', and his obedience to Biblical law.

Second, in accordance with Jewish tradition, eight days after his birth, the infant Christ was formally given his name. The name Jesus (Greek) or Y'shua (Hebrew) means 'Yahweh saves'. When Moses asked God 'what is your name?', God replied 'I am who I am'. Hence the significance of his words in John 8, when Jesus said, "Before Abraham was, I am."

Third, this has traditionally been seen as the first time the blood of Christ was shed, marking the beginning of the process of the redemption of humanity as a precursor to his crucifixion. 

This feast has been observed by the Church since at least the sixth century.


### Seraphim of Sarov, 1833 [6] White
#### 2 January

Born Prókhor Isídorovich Moshnín in 1759 at Kursk in Russia, the son of a merchant, he was 19 years old when he entered the monastery of our Lady of Sarov as a novice. Nine years later he took his monastic vows and was given the religious name Seraphim (which means 'fiery' or 'burning' in Hebrew).

For nearly 30 years, he lived a solitary life of constant prayer and study as a hermit in a neighbouring forest. He became widely-known for his gifts as a staretz, or spiritual director, and thousands made their pilgrimage to experience his gifts of healing both body and soul.

Seraphim taught that the purpose of the Christian life was to receive the Holy Spirit. One of his most popular sayings was, "acquire a peaceful spirit, and around you thousands will be saved."

While he was extraordinarily harsh towards himself in his own spiritual discipline and self-denial, he was always kind and gentle to those he met, calling everyone 'My joy!' and greeting them with a prostration, a kiss and exclaiming "Christ is risen!"

He died on this day in 1833 and is venerated by the Eastern Orthodox Church as an "ikon of Orthodox spirituality".

17 July
Jane Haining, Missionary and Martyr, 1944 [6] Red

Born 6 June 1897 Dunscore, Scotland; died 17 July 1944 Auschwitz Birkenau, German Greater Governance
Christian Missionary, Scottish Mission to the Jews, Budapest 1932–1944
Righteous Among the Nations (Yad Vashem, 1997), British Hero of the Holocaust (UK Government, 2010)

The Liturgy Committee recommends the proposal that Jane Haining be included in the SEC Calendar on account of her faith-filled life and example that saw her die in the Nazi Concentration camp of Auschwitz Birkenau.

Jane Haining was born in the Scottish Borders, lived in Glasgow and felt called as a Church of Scotland Missionary in Budapest, Hungary. Her mission work was caring for Jewish children.  At the outbreak of World War II, she was asked to return to Scotland and refused.  She was subsequently arrested and transported to Auschwitz having refused to abandon the children in her charge. She is the only Scot known to have died in Auschwitz.
Jane Haining is well-known in Hungary (there is a street named for her in Budapest) but less so in Scotland. Work has been going on between SEC and Church of Scotland colleagues on educational materials on Jane Haining and the Holocaust for Scottish schools. There has been a book on her life by Mary Miller, Jane Haining: A Life of Love & Courage, and play by Raymond Raszowski Ross, A Promised Land.
The honour of inclusion in the Calendar would be on a parallel with the Roman Catholic Church’s memorial to Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish Catholic priest and Conventual Franciscan friar who volunteered to die in place of a stranger in the Nazi death camp of Auschwitz. He is venerated as Saint Maximilian Kolbe.
Jane Haining was a faithful Christian, and the only Scot known to have died in Auschwitz. On account of her refusal to abandon those for whom she had care, and her death as a result, she is recognised as Righteous among the Nations (an honorific used by the State of Israel to describe non-Jews who risked their lives during the Holocaust to save Jews from extermination by the Nazis). She is also an outstanding example of Christian witness in a life lived for others – and this case, those of other faiths – and the willingness to face death as a result.
This is an opportunity to not only celebrate Jane Haining, her life and service, but also to include the Church of Scotland, Interfaith partners and the Hungarian community in so doing.
The date suggested, 17 July does not clash with another celebration
