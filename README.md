All information in the description field MUST be in
sentence case (i.e. NOT UPPERCASE) as Outlook 2007+ changes 
uppercase to a blue-formatted heading.

## Reading style

In this style guide I have changed a few of the conventions used in the SEC Calendar and Lectionary to reference Bible passages. This is in the interest of improved clarity.

Reading ranges MUST be laid out in the following formats:

```
Reading 1:1-10
Reading 2:1-10, 15-20
Reading 2:1, 15-20
Reading 3:1-10, (15-20)
Reading 3:(1), 15-20
Reading 3:(1-10), 15-20
Reading 4:1 - 5:10
Reading 4:1-5; 5:1-10
Reading 5:1-5 or Reading 6:1-10, 15-20
```
