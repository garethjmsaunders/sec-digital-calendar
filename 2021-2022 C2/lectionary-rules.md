This is the rule in the current Calendar and Lectionary, p.10, note iv:

"Feasts in Category 4, falling on a day of higher category (other than a weekday in Lent), should be transferred (in chronological order) to the next available weekday."

Looking back to the last printed copy that I have from 1996, it is the same (albeit it is note iii.)

I guess the debate falls on what "in chronological order" means. I think this rule needs to be clarified.

One reading of this leads you to the conclusion that the current guide to the calendar and lectionary offers: St Stephen [4] (26 Dec) falls on a Sunday this year. But being the first Sunday after Christmas, which has a category [2], St Stephen must be translated (in chronological order) to the next day, 27 Dec. And, therefore, St John [4] (27 Dec) needs to be translated (in chronological order) to the next day, 28 Dec. And similarly with Holy Innocents [4] (28 Dec).

But another reading leads us to the conclusion that Kelvin and I seem to share because the key condition of this is "Feasts in Category 4, falling on a day of higher category". Therefore, absolutely, St Stephen [4] (26 Dec) should be bumped because it now clashes with a feast of higher category (Christmas 1 [2]) but it shouldn't take the place of another category 4 feast.

St Stephen [4] cannot be held on 27 December because there is already another category 4 feast on that date (St John [4]), and a category 4 feast does not supersede another category 4 feast. Similarly, it cannot be held on 28 December because there is another category 4 feast on that date (Holy Innocents [4]).

So, St Stephen skates across the top of the next couple of fellow category 4 feasts until it finds either a day of feria or a category 5 or 6 feast to bump out, because in that situation it would take precedence. 

My reading of "in chronological order" means that when we do need to move more than one feast because they clash with higher category feasts then we need to move them in the order that they would originally fall.

So, if feasts A and B need to move

Feast A [4]
Feast B [4]

this rule means that they must be moved in such a way that they retain the order A and B. They can never end up as:

Feast B [4]
Feast A [4]

Because they are now not in chronological order.
